# LandingPage

This project showcases everything I’ve learned from The Odin Project's Foundation course on HTML and CSS. It serves as a practical test of my ability to use both HTML and CSS to design a functional and visually appealing landing page for a website.

In my CSS code, I’ve included comments to explain the key steps I took, particularly how I utilized the Flexbox layout system to achieve the desired structure and design for the website.
